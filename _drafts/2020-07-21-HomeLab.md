![My home lab](/assets/images/top_images/IntuneTOP.png) Couple words about my home lab.

I decided to write this post to share with you some information about my home lab and how it's build.

Last time I decided to sell some devices and buy new one - to have four similiar devices and what is most important - it's not taking a much of space and it's quiet. Why? It is stored under my desk :D

Ok, so let's start from beggining. 

I have four devices:

* HP Prodesk 600 G2
* HP Elitedesk 705 G2
* HP Prodesk 600 G1
* HP Prodesk 600 G1

And one more - Synology DS620Slim.

Everything is connected to Mikrotik hAP acÂ², which have diffrent subnet for my lab.

Let's talk about specyfication and roles for that machines.

## HP Prodesk 600 G1

It will be a main device, where will be installed Hyper-V server core and three machines:

* AD + DNS
* Secondary AD + DNS
*
