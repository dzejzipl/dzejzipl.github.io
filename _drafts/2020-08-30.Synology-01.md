![Synology - Getting started](/assets/images/top_images/SynologyTOP.jpg)Let's start using your Synology - part one. 

One year ago on my home appear a new device - **DS620Slim** - it's a Synology NAS, with 6 bay drives 2,5'. When I received it - has 2GB of RAM. Now has 8GB and it can be used for everything on my home - as backup, as docker host and host for two machines based on Windows Server 2019.

I want to share with you all details how I'm using this device. First post will be about a initial configuration.

So, let's start.

When you receive this device, you need to know what's IP address. You can get this details from your router, but much faster will be run special site on Chrome browser and type: **find.synology.com**. After a while you will see something like this:

When you click "Connect" you will receive a couple of questions. On first step you need to install a newest version of DSM - it's a System for our Synology Devices. 

When the System is istalled, you will need to configure your NAS and provide:

* Name of NAS
* Username
* Password

Second step is configure QuickConnect. It allow us to connect to our device without VPN connection. On some situation - can be a usufeul feature.

When we logon to the device - first what we need is update all packages.
