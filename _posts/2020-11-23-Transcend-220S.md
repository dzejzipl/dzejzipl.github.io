![Quick review of SSD drive: Transcend 220S - 256GB](assets/images/posts/Transcend220S/top.jpg) Quick review: Transcend 220S, which was used on my home lab!

As you know I have my home lab with four HP devices, everything was described earlier [here](https://www.piesik.me/tags/#home-lab). It's used for daily tests with Intune etc. Couple months ago I received a package from **Sarota PR**, which send to me a new SSD disk - *Transcend 220S*.

You can buy this disk on four version: 256GB, 512GB, 1024GB and 2048GB. I was tested 256GB version.

This disk was mounted to my HV03 machine - HP Prodesk G2 DM as additional disk for my virtual machines.

Let's look for specification for those disks:
